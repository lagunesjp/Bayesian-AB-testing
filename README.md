# Bayesian AB testing

This notebook uses an AB test to validate if a digital campaign had a significative change in the daily online conversions of a website. 

The dataset contains three months of daily observations (one month and a half before campaign was launched + one month a half after campain was launched). 

Digital campaign was launched on Valentine's Day (observation 45).
